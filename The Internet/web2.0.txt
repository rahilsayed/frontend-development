A collection of advances in the early 2000s created a cluster of web applications that are often called "Web 2.0". In comparison to early static websites, Web 2.0 applications are often defined by:
    a. Providing a dynamic user experience by offering content that responds to user input without forcing the page to reload.
    b. Emphasizing user-generated content and social sharing.

There were important technical advances that enabled each of these advances in the user interface of the internet. For example:

    a. jQuery was the first JavaScript framework that could fetch data while the web page is running.
    b. The rise of web frameworks that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby-on-Rails, enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.
