<em> Emphasis Element: The <em> emphasis element emphasizes text and browsers will usually italicize the emphasized text by default.


HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content to a web page and instructs web browsers on how to structure that content.


Element Content: The content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element.


<li> List Item Element: The <li> list item element create list items inside:
    Ordered lists <ol>
    Unordered lists <ul>


<video> Video Element: The <video> element embeds a media player for video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display video controls in the media player.
Note: The content inside the opening and closing tag is shown as a fallback in browsers that don’t support the element.


<ol> Ordered List Element: The <ol> ordered list element creates a list of items in sequential order. Each list item appears numbered by default.


<div> Div Element: The <div> element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for “division”. <div> elements can contain flow content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.


HTML Structure: HTML is organized into a family tree structure. HTML elements can have parents, grandparents, siblings, children, grandchildren, etc.


Closing Tag: An HTML closing tag is used to denote the end of an HTML element. The syntax for a closing tag is a left angle bracket < followed by a forward slash / then the element name and a right angle bracket to close >.


Attribute Name and Values: HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax: name="value" and can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behavior of the element.


<br> Line Break Element: The <br> line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is required, like in a postal address. The line break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing tag.


<img> Image Element: HTML image <img> elements embed images in documents. The src attribute contains the image URL and is mandatory. <img> is an empty element meaning it should not have a closing tag.


<h1>-<h6> Heading Elements: HTML can use six different levels of heading elements. The heading elements are ordered from the highest level <h1> to the lowest level <h6>


<p> Paragraph Element: The <p> paragraph element contains and displays a block of text.


HTML Attributes: HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of an element to configure the element or change the element’s default behavior.


<ul> Unordered List Element: The <ul> unordered list element is used to create a list of items in no particular order. Each individual list item will have a bullet point by default.


alt Attribute: An <img> element can have alternative text via the alt attribute. The alternative text will be displayed if an image fails to render due to an incorrect URL, if the image format is not supported by the browser, if the image is blocked from being displayed, or if the image has not been received from the URL. 


Unique ID Attributes: In HTML, specific and unique id attributes can be assigned to different elements in order to differentiate between them.
When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform specific instructions on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should only contain letters (a-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).


<body> Body Element: The <body> element represents the content of an HTML document. Content inside <body> tags are rendered on the web browsers.
Note: There can be only one <body> element in a document.


<span> Span Element: The <span> element is an inline container for text and can be used to group text for styling purposes. However, as <span> is a generic container to separate pieces of text from a larger body of text, its use should be avoided if a more semantic element is available.


<strong> Strong Element: The <strong> element highlights important, serious, or urgent text and browsers will normally render this highlighted text in bold by default.


HTML Element: An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax: opening tag + content + closing tag.


HTML Tag: The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle bracket < followed by the element name and a closing angle bracket >. Here is an example of an opening <div> tag.
